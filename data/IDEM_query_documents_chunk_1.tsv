ADH deficiency and excess can cause acute and chronic symptoms that, in rare cases, may become life-threatening.If there is too little ADH or the kidneys do not respond to ADH, then too much water is lost through the kidneys, the urine produced is more dilute than normal, and the blood becomes more concentrated.DH is normally released by the pituitary in response to sensors that detect an increase in blood osmolality (number of dissolved particles in the blood) or decrease in blood volume. The kidneys respond to ADH by conserving water and producing urine that is more concentrated.	3.569371700286865	1004

178325	effect of salt on water boiling point	7112148	A: Adding salt to water increases the boiling point of water due to a fundamental colligative property of matter known as boiling point elevation. Whenever a solute, such as salt, is added to a solvent, such as water, the boiling point becomes higher than that of the pure solvent.	8.935281753540039	1
178325	effect of salt on water boiling point	8792171	Salt highers the boiling point of water, when your cooking you add salt to the water to make it hotter, thus reducing the cooking time. The salt dissolves in the water and absorbs some of the heat applied to it, so the total temperature goes up.	8.781229019165039	2
178325	effect of salt on water boiling point	7399374	Effect of Salt on the Boiling Temperature of Water. Many people assume that the laws of physics are set in stone. When it comes to the freezing point or boiling point of water, everybody who has ever studied a little bit of science would be able to say water freezes at 32 degrees Fahrenheit and water boils at 212 degrees Fahrenheit.	8.699236869812012	3
178325	effect of salt on water boiling point	8792167	Salt will increase the boiling point and decrease the freezing point of water due to colligative properties. Table salt (NaCl) breaks into ions when dissolved. This lowers the â¦ vapor pressure of water. When salt dissolves its ions are moving around in the water, and some are near the surface.	8.598705291748047	4

178325	effect of salt on water boiling point	1510446	Instead, it makes it take longer for the water to boil! The salt actually increases the boiling point of the water, which is when the tendency for the water to evaporate is greater than the tendency for it to remain a liquid on a molecular level.	8.365416526794434	6
178325	effect of salt on water boiling point	7216038	Most of us are probably aware that adding salt to water during cooking increases waterâs boiling point, and this is also related to vapour pressure. In fact, adding any solute to water will increase the boiling temperature, as it reduces the vapour pressure, meaning a slightly higher temperature is required in order for the vapour pressure to become equal to atmospheric pressure and boil the water.	8.321460723876953	7
178325	effect of salt on water boiling point	2326364	The boiling point of salt water will rise by about half a degree Celsius for every 30 grams of salt dissolved per kilogram (litre) of water. So if you are boiling a pan of water with salt in it, the boiling point will be higher depending on the amount of salt that is dissolved in the water.	8.200462341308594	8

178325	effect of salt on water boiling point	7399376	This is true for something like salt, which elevates the boiling temperature of water in a process known as boiling point elevation. Basically, water is known as a solvent and salt is known as a non-volatile solute. When you add something like salt to a solvent like water, it makes water become an impure solvent and raises its boiling point above that of pure solvents. Though salt raises the boiling point of water, it doesnât do it very much. In most cases, the temperature rise is a matter of only a few degrees F, usually under five. In order to understand this concept, there are many experiments you can conduct, even at home.	8.179911613464355	10
178325	effect of salt on water boiling point	729542	At lower pressures (at high altitudes, for example, in Denver, Colorado), the boiling point will be perhaps a couple of degrees lower. For saltwater, the boiling point is raised, and the melting point is lowered. By how much depends on how much salt there is.

211468	how car gears work	64647	Other Uses for Gears. There are many other ways to use gears. For example, you can use conical gears to bend the axis of rotation in a gear train by 90 degrees. The most common place to find conical gears like this is in the differential of a rear-wheel-drive car. A differential bends the rotation of the engine 90 degrees to drive the rear wheels: Another specialized gear train is called a planetary gear train.	6.539344787597656	8

211468	how car gears work	4087552	The driver must shift from gear to gear. Normally, a manual transmission bolts to a clutch housing (or bell housing) that, in turn, bolts to the back of the engine. If the vehicle has front-wheel drive, the transmission still attaches to the engine in a similar fashion but is usually referred to as a transaxle. This is because the transmission, differential and drive axles are one complete unit. In a front-wheel-drive car, the transmission also serves as part of the front axle for the front wheels. In the remaining text, a transmission and transaxle will both be referred to using the term transmission. The function of any transmission is transferring engine power to the driveshaft and rear wheels (or axle halfshafts and front wheels in a front-wheel-drive vehicle). Gears inside the transmission change the vehicle's drive-wheel speed and torque in relation to engine speed and torque.	2.9390251636505127	1004

274981	how many atp does glycolysis produce	8404040	Glycolysis is the major pathway of glucose metabolism and occurs in the cytosol of all cells. It can occur aerobically or anaerobically depending on whether oxygen is available. This is clinically significant because oxidation of glucose under aerobic conditions results in 32 mol of ATP per mol of glucose. However, under anaerobic conditions, only 2 mol of ATP can be produced. Aerobic glycolysis occurs in 2 steps. The first occurs in the cytosol and involves the conversion of glucose to pyruvate with resultant production of NADH. This process alone generates 2 molecules of ATP.	7.404714107513428	1002

Electron drift, which is the current within any conductor, including air when the voltage potential gets high enough, is in the order of 20,000 km/s. The actual speed varies with the conductor and other conditions. But most electron drifts hover between 15,000 kps and 25,000 kps. The speed of sound also varies. But we can specify a standard day and the speed of sound is 0.343333 kps. So the speed of a bolt through the air is N = 20000/.343 = 58309 Mach.	5.416749477386475	8
