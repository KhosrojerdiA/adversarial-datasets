How quickly chemical weathering breaks a rock down is directly proportional to the area of rock surface exposed. Thus, it is also related to mechanical weathering, which creates more exposed surface area by breaking the rock down into pieces, and those pieces into smaller pieces. The greater the number of pieces, the greater the total amount of surface area exposed to chemical weathering.	-11.1282377243042	1009

When threatened, many species of octopusesâas well as most other cephalopodsâwill discharge a cloud of dark ink. The ink is composed primarily of melanin, which is the same pigment that darkens the skin of humans and many other animals. It also contains tyrosinase, a substance that irritates potential predators' eyes and disrupts their sense of smell. Under cover of this irritating, camouflaging ink, the octopus can often escape.	2.174700260162353	4

If income and other determinants of demand such as tastes of the consumers, changes in prices of related goods, income distribution, etc., remain constant and there is a change only in price of the commodity, then we move along the same demand curve. In this case, the demand curve remains unchanged. When, as a result of change in price, the quantity demanded increases or decreases, it is technically called extension and contraction in demand. The demand curve, which represents various price quantity has a negative slope. Whenever there is a change in the quantity demanded of a good due to change, in its price, there is a movement from one point price quantity combination to another on the. same demand curve.

645252	what does pbr322 do	1990198	One of the most common plasmids used is the R-plasmid (or pBR322). This plasmid contains a replication origin, several recognition sequences for different restriction enzymes (with names like EcoRI), and two marker genes, which confer resistance to different antibiotics (ampicillin and tetracycline).enes can be cloned by cloning the bacterial cells that contain them, but this requires quite a lot of DNA in the first place. PCR can clone (or amplify) DNA samples as small as a single molecule. It is a newer technique, having been developed in 1983 by Kary Mullis, for which discovery he won the Nobel prize in 1993.	4.367275238037109	9

669427	what hormone secretion causes goiter	2265028	1 Thyroid gland functions include the secretion of two major hormones T3 (also called Triiodothyronine) and T4 (also known as Thyroxine or Tetraiodothyronine). 2  T3 is physiologically more active and more potent than T4.3  T3 and T4 are collectively called thyroid hormones (TH).odine deficiency is the most common cause of goiter which is considered as one of the thyroid diseases. Thyroid hormones (TH) are secreted mainly in response to TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) released from the pituitary gland.	7.905003547668457	1
669427	what hormone secretion causes goiter	7682644	What Causes a Goiter? Goiters can occur when the thyroid gland produces either too much thyroid hormone (hyperthyroidism) or not enough (hypothyroidism). Much more rarely, the problem may arise when the pituitary gland stimulates thyroid growth to boost production of the hormone.	7.76068115234375	2
669427	what hormone secretion causes goiter	4132982	This signal is called thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). As the name implies, this hormone stimulates the thyroid to produce thyroid hormone and to grow in size. This abnormal growth in size produces what is termed a âgoiter.â Thus, iodine deficiency is one cause of goiter development. Wherever iodine deficiency is common, goiter will be common.	7.459378242492676	3
669427	what hormone secretion causes goiter	273003	Goiters can also be caused by ingestion of goitrogens (ie, substances that block formation of thyroid hormone), which can be found in turnip, cabbage, and kale, or they can occur as a familial form. Malignancy occurs in 5-15% of substernal goiters.	6.965418338775635	4

669427	what hormone secretion causes goiter	5969506	Thyroxine, also known as T4, is the primary hormone secreted by the thyroid gland; this hormone helps control our metabolism, a chemical process that turns our food into energy. A lack of iodine in your food can cause the thyroid to swell, a condition called a goiter.	6.484817028045654	7
669427	what hormone secretion causes goiter	7626133	A diet deficient in iodine can cause a goiter, but this is rarely the cause because of the readily available iodine in our diets. A more common cause of goiter in America is an increase in thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in response to a defect in normal hormone synthesis within the thyroid gland.	6.4254961013793945	8
669427	what hormone secretion causes goiter	6857991	However, TSI also stimulates the thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone (causes hyperthyroidism). Since the pituitary senses too much thyroid hormone, it stops secreting TSH. In spite of this the thyroid gland continues to grow and make thyroid hormone. Therefore, Gravesâ disease produces a goiter and hyperthyroidism. goiter can occur in a gland that is producing too much hormone (hyperthyroidism), too little hormone (hypothyroidism), or the correct amount of hormone (euthyroidism). A goiter indicates there is a condition present which is causing the thyroid to grow abnormally.	6.351815700531006	9
669427	what hormone secretion causes goiter	1045962	Hyperthyroidism is also a cause of goiter - from an overactive thyroid gland, which produces too much thyroid hormone. This usually happens as a result of Graves' disease, also an autoimmune disorder in which the body's immunity turns on itself and attacks the thyroid gland, causing it to swell.3.	6.308315753936768	10
669427	what hormone secretion causes goiter	5303471	Goiter is a swelling (hypertrophy) of a gland in the neck called the thyroid gland. 1-3 The thyroid gland is situated in front of the windpipe and is responsible for producing and secreting hormones that regulate growth and metabolism. Treatment is not necessary unless the goiter is large and causes symptoms (there are often no symptoms). 2  Synthetic thyroid hormone is a treatment for underactive thyroid, while anti-thyroid drugs are options for an overactive gland.	4.841930866241455	1000

721409	what is average mileage on a car	1602705	The average car is driven about 10,000 miles a year. This means that most cars have about 15 years worth of mileage. This fact allows us to combine mileage life and years of life into a single unit of measurement. In other words, a typical car has 15 year of life and 15 mileage units of 10,000 miles each. Thus, a brand new car has 30 units of life. As a car ages and is driven, these units are used up.

721409	what is average mileage on a car	7562523	How Much Mileage Is Too Much for a Used Car? The rule of thumb is that if a car is well over 110,000 miles, itâs probably too much mileage.

So, for example, a four-year-old vehicle with 54,000 (13,500 miles per year) is right in the middle of that bracket. Anything above that is considered a high-mileage used car, and anything below is considered low-mileage.	7.937024116516113	8
