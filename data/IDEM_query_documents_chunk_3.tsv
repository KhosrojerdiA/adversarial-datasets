I will tell you that intrusive (or plutonic) means the igneous rock is formed within the earth's crust. Since it forms within the crust it will cool more slowly than an extrusive (or volcanic) igneous rock that cools quickly at the surface. The slower magma cools, the larger the crystals will be since they have more time to organize themselves into larger crystal structures.	5.789460182189941	1003
891719	what rocks have cooled slowly beneath the earth's surface	2239830	There are places on Earth that are so hot that rocks melt to form magma. Because magma is liquid and usually less dense than surrounding solid rock, it moves upward to cooler regions of the Earth. As the magma loses heat, it cools and crystallizes into an igneous rock. Magma can cool on the Earth's surface, where it has erupted from a volcano (extrusive rock) or under the Earth's surface, where it has intruded older rocks (intrusive rock).	5.505438327789307	1004

954711	when should sutures be removed	7929566	Sutures may be absorbent (dissolvable) or non-absorbent (must be removed). Non-absorbent sutures are usually removed within 7 to 14 days. Suture removal is determined by how well the wound has healed and the extent of the surgery. Sutures must be left in place long enough to establish wound closure with enough strength to support internal tissues and organs. The health care provider must assess the wound to determine whether or not to remove the sutures. The wound line must also be observed for separations during the process of suture removal. Removal of sutures must be ordered by the primary health care provider (physician or nurse practitioner).	9.12636947631836	5

The sutures have to be removed to prevent them from growing into the new and healthy skin that has formed. Absorbable stitches do not need to be removed. They are made of special materials that can remain in the body for an extended period of time. Over weeks or months, your body dissolves the sutures, well after your incision has closed.	6.359323978424072	1000
954711	when should sutures be removed	761667	If the incision has a lot of tension (is very tight), some surgeons will leave the sutures in longer.

For the first three months, there will be a raised, red healing ridge at the laceration site. Over the next two to three months, the ridge will flatten and then will start to weather and lighten. It may take six to eight months or longer before the final result of the laceration repair can be appreciated.	5.9379401206970215	1002
954711	when should sutures be removed	572374	There are two kinds of stitches, those which are absorbable (or dissolvable) and will break down harmlessly in the body over time, and those that are non-absorbable (or non-dissolvable) and must be manually removed by the surgeon. There are also different kinds of absorbable sutures, made with different materials. Therefore, after you have had your wisdom teeth removed, or after any kind of oral surgery, absorbable sutures might take from a few days to a few weeks to dissolve completely.	5.46129035949707	1003
954711	when should sutures be removed	2401459	If your surgeon used a fast absorbing gut suture, it should dissolve within 7-10 days. In many cases the body digests the suture material under the skin before the visible portion of the suture thread actually falls off. Therefore, you may still see some suture material on the skin at 10 days or so.	5.193443775177002	1004

959854	when was slash and burn agriculture used	7937058	Slash-and-burn agriculture refers to the process of cutting down a forest, burning the trees, and then using the cleared land to grow crops. This agricultural approachâused mainly in tropical countriesâis the leading cause of tropical deforestation. Usually, some type of slash-and-burn system is used when vast areas of tropical rain forest are converted into large-scale, industrial farms. However, slash-and-burn is more often used by individual, poor farmers who migrate to the forest frontier in search of land on which to grow food. Poor farmers operate on a smaller scale, but since there are many such people, huge areas are ultimately affected.	7.833613872528076	1

Common types of movement that result from muscle contraction include: Flexion â A movement that decreases the angle between two bones at the joint. Extension â A movement that increases the angle between two bones at the joint. However, if the angle goes past 180o (a straight line) in the direction opposite flexion the movement is called hyperextension. Rotation â Rotation is a movement that results in movement of one bone around its longitudinal axis.	6.889491558074951	9

Tulips are familiar to millions worldwide, but very few people have had the opportunity to see them growing in their original, natural habitat. Thatâs because tulips are native to some of the most remote places on earth, on hard-to-reach mountain ridges and barren steppes. About a dozen years ago, I and a few friends and colleagues, most of them in the Dutch bulb industry, began to travel to the lands where tulips grow wild. We donât often go as a complete groupâour schedules rarely allow thatâbut between us we have covered a lot of ground over the years.	7.441099166870117	6

The flowers come in a wide variety of colors and are a particularly favorite choice for spring wedding bouquets. Tulips grow from seeds or bulbs. Nature does its job in spreading the seeds that form into the bulbs that become part of the flowering plant. Seeds Reproduce. Tulips Like other plants, tulips must disperse seeds for the flower to germinate and grow. The ways in which the seeds are spread affect how well tulips reproduce in both quantity and quality. Tulip seeds are dispersed by several different methods in nature.	5.184427738189697	1000

1000030	where does microtubule formation occur	5232409	Microtubule-organizing centers function as the site where microtubule formation begins, as well as a location where free-ends of microtubules attract to. Within the cells, microtubule-organizing centers can take on many different forms. An array of microtubules can arrange themselves in a pinwheel structure to form the basal bodies, which can lead to the formation of microtubule arrays in the cytoplasm or the 9+2 axoneme. Other arrangements range from fungi spindle pole bodies to the eukaryotic chromosal kinetochores (flat, laminated plaques).	8.150717735290527	1
1000030	where does microtubule formation occur	7263579	In the cell itself, microtubules are formed in an area near the nucleus called the aster. This is also called the Microtubule Organizing Center (MTOC). Microtubules are polar with a plus end (fast growing) and a minus end (slow growing). Usually the minus end is the anchor point in the MTOC. In this figure, the plus end is shown to the left by the numerous tubulin dimers.	7.754571437835693	2
1000030	where does microtubule formation occur	5232408	The microtubule-organizing center (MTOC) is a structure found in eukaryotic cells from which microtubules emerge.

1000030	where does microtubule formation occur	7264228	Therefore as long as there is no hydrolysis of beta GTP bound tubule the cap tubulin can polymerize onto the end, leading to microtubule growth. Tau is therefore present in cell bodies so that microtubule assembly can occur so that it projects out to form the axonal core for vesicle and organelle transportation. Further upstream towards the n terminal is a proline-gylcine-glycine rich region which causes a sharp turn in the polypeptide which causes the N terminal to project away from the microtubule.	6.310373783111572	4

Microtubules are necessary for cell division and movement. Most cells produce Î±-tubulin, but the protein is found in highest amounts in the developing brain.During brain development, Î±-tubulin partners with Î²-tubulin to form microtubules that move nerve cells (neurons) to their proper location (neuronal migration).he TUBA1A gene provides instructions for making a protein called alpha-tubulin (Î±-tubulin). This protein is part of the tubulin family of proteins that form and organize structures called microtubules.

The movement results from a shortening of the spindle microtubules. Each chromosome is pulled along by its centromere. Formally, this phase begins when the duplicated centromeres of each pair of sister chromatids separates, and the resulting daughter chromosomes begin moving toward the poles.	7.699942588806152	6

1001108	where the chromosomes are moving towards the poles of the cell	4128964	Definition: Spindle fibers are aggregates of microtubules that move chromosomes during cell division. During prophase of mitosis, spindle fibers form at opposite poles of the cell. During metaphase, spindle fibers extend from the cell poles toward the midpoint of the cell known as the metaphase plate. Chromosomes are held at the metaphase plate by the equal forces of the spindle fibers pushing on the centromeres of the chromosomes. In anaphase, spindle fibers pull sister chromatids toward the spindle poles. Spindle fibers not connected to chromatids lengthen and elongate the cell.	7.566128730773926	9

1019405	which soils are prone to erosion	310789	Agriculture. Soil erosion removes valuable top soil which is the most productive part of the soil profile for agricultural purposes. The loss of this top soil results in lower yields and higher production costs. When top soil is gone, erosion can cause rills and gullies that make the cultivation of paddocks impossible. The impacts of erosion on cropping lands include: 1  reduced ability of the soil to store water and nutrients. 2  exposure of subsoil, which often has poor physical and chemical properties.	3.944784641265869	1000
1019405	which soils are prone to erosion	8455942	Sheet Erosion. There are different types of soil erosion caused by water. Sheet erosion is erosion that occurs fairly evenly over an area.

1019405	which soils are prone to erosion	117063	Water Erosion and Surface Water Runoff. One of the main causes of soil erosion is water erosion, which is the loss of topsoil due to water. Raindrops fall directly on topsoil. The impact of the raindrops loosens the material bonding it together, allowing small fragments to detach.	3.521713256835937	1002
1019405	which soils are prone to erosion	3140477	Erosion is any process that transports soil from one place to another. At naturally occurring rates, land typically loses about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) of topsoil in 100 to 250 years. A tolerable rate of soil erosion is considered to be 48 to 80 pounds of soil per acre (55 to 91 kilograms per hectare) each year.	3.3062684535980225	1003
1019405	which soils are prone to erosion	7809770	Water erosion is the most pertinent erosion problem in Iowa.

1024069	what neuron causes a muscle to move	8830486	Alpha motor neurons (also called lower motor neurons) innervate skeletal muscle and cause the muscle contractions that generate movement. Motor neurons release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at a synapse called the neuromuscular junction. Thus, there is a one-to-one relationship between a muscle and a motor neuron pool. 2  Each individual muscle fiber in a muscle is innervated by one, and only one, motor neuron (make sure you understand the difference between a muscle and a muscle fiber). 3  A single motor neuron, however, can innervate many muscle fibers.	8.922449111938477	2
1024069	what neuron causes a muscle to move	8299208	Since the efferent neurons are nerves that leave the central nervous system in order to initiate muscle movement, we call them motor neurons.

1024069	what neuron causes a muscle to move	1581127	These structures act indirectly on motor output, via outputs through the thalamus to widespread areas of the cerebral cortex. Key Concepts: All voluntary movement involves motor neurons in the spinal cord and brainstem that cause contraction of skeletal muscles. Neurons in many areas of the brain and spinal cord are active at overlapping times to control voluntary movements. The spinal cord can produce coordinated movements of the limbs, such as locomotion, as well as simple reflexes.	7.67431640625	9
1024069	what neuron causes a muscle to move	1850294	Upon receiving a signal from a neuron, the muscle cells open the calcium channels in their cell membrane, and the calcium ions rush in due to the voltage difference between the inside and outside of the cell. These ions then interact with actin and myosin filaments to cause muscle contraction. The muscles remain in the contracted state until adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binds to myosin, releasing the myosin and actin filaments from one another.	7.618142127990723	10
