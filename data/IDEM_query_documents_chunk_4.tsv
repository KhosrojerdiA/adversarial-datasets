1059496	what is blue ice in a lake	3511138	Science of Why Glacier Ice and Lake Ice Appears Blue. The blue ice of Grey Glacier at Torres del Paine National Park in Chile is blue because there aren't bubbles in it to scatter light. by Anne Marie Helmenstine, Ph.D. Glacier ice and frozen lakes appear blue, yet icicles and ice from your freezer appear clear. Why is ice blue? The quick answer is that it's because water absorbs other colors of the spectrum, so the one that's reflected back to your eyes is blue. To understand why, you need to understand how light interacts with water and ice. Why Water and Ice Are Blue In both its liquid and solid form, water (H 2 O) molecules absorb red and yellow light, so the reflected light is blue. The oxygen-hydrogen bond (O-H bond) stretch in response to incoming energy from light, absorbing energy in the red part of the spectrum.	7.550631999969482	1

1059496	what is blue ice in a lake	7242860	Blue iceberg. A blue iceberg is visible after the ice from above the water melts, causing the smooth portion of ice from below the water to overturn. The rare blue ice is formed from the compression of pure snow, which then develops into glacial ice. Icebergs may also appear blue due to light refraction and age. Older icebergs reveal vivid hues of green and blue, resulting from a high concentration of color, microorganisms, and compacted ice.

1059496	what is blue ice in a lake	985867	Blue ice (glacial) Blue ice occurs when snow falls on a glacier, is compressed, and becomes part of the glacier. Air bubbles are squeezed out and ice crystals enlarge, making the ice appear blue. Small amounts of regular ice appear to be white because of air bubbles inside them and also because small quantities of water appear to be colourless. In glaciers, the pressure causes the air bubbles to be squeezed out, increasing the density of the created ice.	5.408773422241211	6

Blue ice means thick, safe and strong ice â a good thing to know when crossing a frozen sea. So, why were last weekend's snowbanks so brilliantly blue? This was a heavy, wet, dense snow with as much as five times the weight of dry snow. Wet snow will, because there is more of it in a given area, absorb a lot more red light than dry snow.	5.01099967956543	7

1086224	what causes boiling point to increase	4187447	When boiling point is increased due to the addition of a NON-VOLATILE SOLUTE to the solution. This is because adding a non-volatile solute will decrease the vapor pressure of the solvent (decrease the partial pressure of the solvent above the solution) and thus it will take more energy to exceed the external pressure.	9.104294776916504	1
1086224	what causes boiling point to increase	4367167	In general, things dissolved in water (and milk is mostly water) will raise the boiling point. Roughly speaking, the greater the density (number per volume) of molecules dissolved, the greater the increase in the boiling point.	8.36370849609375	2
1086224	what causes boiling point to increase	4478973	Generally speaking, boiling points increase as carbon chain length increases. This is because there are more atoms present in the hydrocarbon molecule and therefore more intermolecular forces (eg Van der Waals') that must be overcome.	8.199286460876465	3
1086224	what causes boiling point to increase	1960883	The attractions and therefore the melting and boiling points increase because: 1  The nuclei of the atoms are getting more positively charged. 2  The sea is getting more negatively charged. 3  The sea is getting progressively nearer to the nuclei and so more strongly attracted.	8.123356819152832	4
1086224	what causes boiling point to increase	4808149	The boiling point of water can also be increased slightly by dissolving a substance, such as salt or sugar, into the water. The equations provided show how to calculate the increase in boiling point temperature based on adding a fixed quantity of salt.

1086224	what causes boiling point to increase	7112148	A: Adding salt to water increases the boiling point of water due to a fundamental colligative property of matter known as boiling point elevation. Whenever a solute, such as salt, is added to a solvent, such as water, the boiling point becomes higher than that of the pure solvent.	7.915497779846191	6
1086224	what causes boiling point to increase	4261972	The boiling points increases depending on the intermolecular forces between the molecules.

1086224	what causes boiling point to increase	5766468	If the atmospheric pressure is exactly 1 atm, the boiling point of water is 100.0 degrees Celsius. This is because the vapor pressure of water is 1 atm at this temperature. If you increase the pressure, the boiling point will increase because more energy will be needed to raise the vapor pressure to the increased atmospheric pressure. Likewise, if you decrease the pressure, the boiling point will decrease.	7.768915176391602	8
1086224	what causes boiling point to increase	7112144	The reason why the boiling point rises when solute is added to a solvent has to do with vapor pressure. A liquid boils when its vapor pressure is equal to that of the atmosphere. Vapor pressure of a solution increases as it is heated.	7.689130306243896	9
1086224	what causes boiling point to increase	5554141	Answers. Best Answer: Solute changes the boiling point of the solvent. In fact when solute is added in a solvent then after adding the solute the boiling point of the solution increases. For example, if salt is added in water then the boiling point of water will increase from 100 degree Celsius.

1086224	what causes boiling point to increase	8547928	So yes, salt increases the boiling temperature, but not by very much. If you add 20 grams of salt to five litres of water, instead of boiling at 100Â° C, itâll boil at 100.04Â° C. So a big spoon of salt in a pot of water will increase the boiling point by four hundredths of a degree! So adding salt to water will not cook your pasta faster â unless your watch is calibrated in microseconds. If you are in that much of a hurry, you should run with your pasta to the dining table, not walk. Just be happy with the knowledge that salt does improve the flavour.	4.706991672515869	1003

1086834	what are the signs of kidney failure in dogs with dm?	2456144	Answers. Best Answer: 2.69 x10^22 atoms per liter can be rewritten as 2.69 x10^22 atoms per dm^3 So, what I would do is calculate the volume of a single atom in cubic decimeters. That means you need to change 69 pm to its equivalent amount in dm.Then, use the formula for volume of a sphere to get the volume of one Ne atom.hen, multiply that value by 2.69 x10^22 atoms. That gives you the total atomic volume in dm^3 which you can then compare to the total volume of 1 dm^3 Here's the change from pm to dm: 69 pm times (1 dm / 10^11 pm) = 69 x 10^-11 dm = 6.9 x 10^-10 dm.

Because of their size â between 2 and 6 microns in diameter â anthrax spores can be easily aerosolized and occupy the lower respiratory mucosa in humans when inhaled. Accordingly, aerosolized anthrax spores are the form most likely to be used in an anthrax bioterrorism attack.	7.3243231773376465	2

Anthrax is a non-motile organism between 1-5 micrometers in length. Upon exposure to air, anthrax forms a spore, which can become airborne to cause infection to exposed individuals. Anthrax spore can cause disease by coming in contact with abraded skin or wounds; inhalation; or ingestion. As anthrax reproduces, it releases three virulence factors: lethal factor, edema factor and antiphagocytic factor. Each of these substances enhances the destruction of cells and resists the immune system.	5.928446292877197	3

1100980	during which phase does a cell spend the majority of its life cycle?	6667912	Best Answer: Interphase is the phase of the cell cycle in which the cell spends the majority of its time and performs the majority of its purposes. During interphase the cell obtains nutrients, and it is considered as the living phase of the cell. Most eukaryotic cells spend most of their time in interphase. Interphase is a resting phase. This is the longest part of the cell cycle. There are 3 stages of interphase: G1, in which the cell grows and functions normally. During this time, a lot of protein synthesis occurs and the cell grows - more organelles are produced and increasing the volume of the cytoplasm.	7.340945243835449	6
1100980	during which phase does a cell spend the majority of its life cycle?	3513345	During the cell cycle, a cell grows, prepares for division, and divides to create two daughter cells. The three main stages of the cell cycle are interphase, mitosis, and cytokinesis. Cells spend most of their lives, about 78 percent of the time, not dividing in a phase called interphase.	7.233304977416992	7
