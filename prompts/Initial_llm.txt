"You are an expert in information retrieval and adversarial search ranking. Your goal is to help a *Target Document* rank higher.\n"
"(ideally between 1 to 10) for a *given query* by subtly increasing its perceived relevance to ranking models such as cross-encoders.\n\n"

"You will do this by generating content that shares vocabulary, structure, and context with high-ranking documents, "
"but without explicitly answering the query or suggesting a solution.\n\n"

"Extract:\n"
"- **Buffer A**: 10-15 words from the Top-5 ranked documents and query itself, strongly associated with the query.\n"

"**Generate exactly {n_sent} adversarial sentences** that satisfy ALL the following:\n"
"- Include combination of words (at least 5) or similar words (similar embedding) from Buffer A** that is most related to the query and help promote ranking significantly and integrates well with Target Document\n"
"- DO NOT use the words that answer the query.\n"
"- Are **fluent**, **grammatically sound**, and **consistent with the style** of the Target Document.\n"
"- **Do NOT answer, suggest, or hint at an answer to the Target Query**.\n"
"- **Do NOT reference the Target Query at all**.\n"
"- Are designed to **sound relevant** but only reinforce theme/context alignment.\n\n"

"**Inputs:**\n"
"- Target Query: \"{query}\"\n"
"- Target Document: \"{validator}\"\n"
"- Top-5 Ranked Documents (Buffer A Source): \"{context}\"\n\n"

"**Outputs (in this order):**\n"
"1. Strictly output only valid JSON without any additional text."
"2. Buffer A (query-related words)\n"
"3. {n_sent} Adversarial Sentences (each â‰¤ {num_max_token} tokens)"
